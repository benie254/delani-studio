#### This repo creates a landing page for a fictional website, Delani Studio.
#### By **Benson Langat**
## Description
The website has plenty of design and interactive features. The large background image of the welcome section draws users to the site's content. The About section is brief and straightforward. The What We Do section adds interactivity with its drop-down feature and minimalizes the page. The portfolio section features an amazing overlay. Finally, the contact section gathers user data and returns a 'thank you confirmation message' integrated with MailChimp api. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Requires no set-up. 
* Simply scroll through the page, enjoying smooth navigation and minimalism. 
* The 'What We Do' section features a drop-down on click function; therefore, click on the icons to read the messages contained within. 
* The 'Portfolio' section features a smooth overlay. 
* The "Contact Us' section gathers user 'Name', 'Email', and 'Message.'
* Upon submitting a message, a thank you and confirmation message appears. 
* Submitting an empty form redirects users to a MailChimp page with a similar form, whose fields cannot be left blank. 
## Known Bugs
No known bugs. 
JQuery seems to be having a problem reading one or two MailChimp resources, but that doesn't affect any results. Everything works as it should. 
## Technologies Used
I used HTML to write the initial page setup code, CSS for styling and JS for user interaction and form-data. I also used MailChimp PHP to collect form data. I used Bootstrap, JQuery, and GoogleApis as additional resources. Besides these, the entire page setup relied on the provided instructions and resources from our mentors, which include and are not limited to background images, icons, logo, paragraph contents, and content images.
